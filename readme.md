# SnapSafe - Hack the North 2025
SnapSafe is an augmented-reality (AR) navigation system aimed to help people with vision-impairments navigate exits in the case of a fire. Powered by Gemini API, the user simply asks for the nearest fire exit, at which point SnapSafe locates and overlays directional cues to the nearest visible fire-exit using Snap Spectacles.
