The dataset includes 367 images.
Exit-sign are annotated in YOLO v7 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -35 and +35 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -35 and +35 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
